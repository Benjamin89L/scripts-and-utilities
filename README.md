=====================

Scripts and Utilities for cmd.exe and (ba)sh etc.

[`github_repos.pl`](https://github.com/renenyffenegger/scripts-and-utilities/blob/master/github_repos.pl) is the script
I use to automatically pull or clone my [github repostiories](https://github.com/ReneNyffenegger?tab=repositories) when
I use a new computer or a computer on which I haven't worked for time.

[`gitp.pl`](https://github.com/renenyffenegger/scripts-and-utilities/blob/master/gitp.pl) does a `git push` to the «correct»
server. Requires the *envorinment variable* `TQ84_GITHUB_PW` to be set with the password of the remote repository.

[`hex_dump.pl`](https://github.com/renenyffenegger/scripts-and-utilities/blob/master/hex_dump.pl) (currently) shows the line
endings of text files. Compare with [Data::HexDump](https://github.com/ReneNyffenegger/PerlModules/tree/master/Data/HexDump).
